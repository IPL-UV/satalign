It enables aligning temporal data cubes with reference images using advanced techniques such as Phase Cross-Correlation (PCC), Enhanced Cross-Correlation (ECC), and Local Geometric Matching (LGM). This package facilitates the manipulation and processing of large volumes of Earth observation data efficiently. Key features \u2728 Advanced alignment algorithms : Leverages ECC, PCC, and LGM to accurately align multi-temporal images. \ud83d\udd0d Efficient data cube management : Processes large data cubes with memory and processing optimizations. \ud83e\udde9 Support for local feature models : Utilizes models like SuperPoint, SIFT, and more for keypoint matching. \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Parallelization : Executes alignment processes across multiple cores for faster processing. \ud83d\ude80 Installation \u2699\ufe0f Install the latest version from PyPI: pip install satalign To use the PCC module, you need to install additional dependencies: pip install satalign [ pcc ] Alternatively, if you already have satalign installed: pip install scikit-image To use the LGM module, you need to install additional dependencies: pip install satalign [ deep ] How to use \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Align an ee.ImageCollection with satalign.pcc.PCC \ud83c\udf0d Load libraries import ee import fastcubo import satalign import satalign.pcc import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from IPython.display import Image , display Auth and Init GEE # Initialize depending on the environment ee .
